Sign Language to Text Recognition 🤟🔤🔢
This project converts hand gestures into text using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and a CNN model. It supports both digits (0-9) and alphabets (A-Z) for seamless communication with individuals who use sign language.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time hand gesture detection
✅ Converts digits (0-9) & alphabets (A-Z) into text
✅ Uses OpenCV & MediaPipe for hand tracking
✅ Deep learning model for accurate classification
✅ Works with any standard webcam

📌 How It Works?
1️⃣ The camera captures a hand gesture.
2️⃣ OpenCV & MediaPipe detect the hand region.
3️⃣ The cropped image is fed into a CNN model for classification.
4️⃣ The predicted letter or digit is displayed on the screen.

Libraries used : 
Opencv - cvzone
Mediapipe - mediapipe
